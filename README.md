# Blue Protocol Module Calculator

A web-based tool to calculate the best combinations of modules in **Blue Protocol**, optimizing for total levels, highest levels, or balanced performance. It allows you to import module data via CSV, dynamically calculate stats, and export results for further analysis.

### 🎮 Optimize Your Best DPS, Healer, Tank & Support Builds

## 🔢 **Calculation Methods**

Your calculator supports **10 different combination-ranking modes**, each using a different sorting algorithm.
Below is the **complete list with short explanations matching your code**.

### **1️⃣ Total Level Mode (`total`)**

Ranks combos by the **sum of all stat levels**.
Good for builds that care about **overall stat coverage**.

Formula:
`score = sum(levels of all stats)`

### **2️⃣ Highest Levels Mode (`highest`)**

Ranks combos by **how many high-level stats** they have.
Level 6 > level 5 > level 4 → all the way down.
Great for builds that prioritize **top-tier stats**.

### **3️⃣ Ability Score Mode (`abilityScore`)**

Uses the game-like **Ability Score formula** (your `calculateSolutionScore`).
This is your **in-game accurate scoring mode**.

### **4️⃣ Target Level Mode (`targetLevel`)**

Ranks combos by how close they are to your **custom target level** for each stat.
Level is always computed normally — target only affects scoring.

Good for:

* hitting breakpoints
* build planning
* “I want level 4 Crit, level 3 ATK SPD, etc.”

Lower difference = better.

### **5️⃣ Smart Combination Mode (`smart`)**

Hybrid mode that combines 3 layers:

1. **More high-level stats first**
2. If tied → **higher total levels**
3. If tied → **higher raw stat sum**

This is the most “intelligent” all-around scorer.

### **6️⃣ Weighted Power Mode (`weighted`)**

Higher levels are given **exponential value**:

```
weights = [0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
```

Level 6 is **32×** stronger than level 1.

Good for:

* DPS builds
* high-impact stats
* crit / special-attack stacking

### **7️⃣ Balanced Mode (`balanced`)**

Ranks combos by **even distribution** of stat levels.

Prefers:

* higher average
* **lower variance**

Great for hybrid roles or supports that want balanced stats.

### **8️⃣ Spike Mode (`spike`)**

Focuses on **maximizing your single strongest stat**.

If two combos have the same highest-level stat:
→ higher total level wins.

Good for:

* “max Crit”
* “max Special Attack”
* any single-stat spike playstyle

### **9️⃣ Efficiency Mode (`efficiency`)**

Ranks combos by:

```
(raw stat sum) / (number of high-level stats)
```

This rewards:

* combos that give **a lot of stats per high-level slot**
* efficient module value

Useful for cost/value analysis.

### **🔟 Synergy Mode (`synergy`)**

Rewards combos where **paired stats rise together**.

Default synergy pairs:

```
Attack SPD ↔ Crit Focus
Healing Boost ↔ Healing Enhance
Strength Boost ↔ Special Attack
```

Extra synergy is added when both stats rise in parallel.

Best for:

* classes that rely on stat pairs
* healer builds
* combo-based scaling

## 📘 **How It Works**

### 1️⃣. Open the Calculator

Open the `index.html` file in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.). No installation required.

### 2️⃣. **Import CSV**

- Click the **file input** to select a CSV file containing module data.
- The CSV must have the following format:

```csv
Module Name,Strength Boost,Agility Boost,Intellect,Special Attack,Elite Strike,Healing Boost,...
X1,5,3,4,2,1,0,...
X2,6,2,3,1,2,1,...
````

* The calculator will automatically populate the table with the imported modules.

### 3️⃣. **Select Stats**

You can:

* ✔ Show all stats
* ✔ Hide stats
* ✔ Auto-select by role (DPS / Healer / Tank / Support)
* ✔ Auto-select using Maxroll presets

* Edit stat values directly in the table.
* Toggle visibility of specific stats using the **checkbox panel**.
* Add new modules using the **+ Add Module** button or remove existing ones.

### 4️⃣. **Calculate Combos**

* Choose a calculation method:

  * **Total Level** – sums up levels across all stats.
  * **Highest Levels** – prioritizes the modules with the most high-level stats.
* The calculator displays:

  * Top Total combos
  * Top combos per stat
  * Best Balanced combos
   
The tool:

* Generates every possible **4-module combination**
* Calculates individual stat levels
* Scores using:

  * Basic Power Map
  * Special Power Map
  * Total Attribute Power

### 5️⃣. Export Results

* **Export Imported Table CSV** – downloads your input data.
* **Export All Output Tables CSV** – downloads the computed results for top combinations.

## 🧠 **Score Calculation Formula**

### Thresholds

```
[1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20]
```

### Basic Attributes Power Map

```
{1:7, 2:14, 3:29, 4:44, 5:167, 6:254}
```

### Special Attributes Power Map

```
{1:14, 2:29, 3:59, 4:89, 5:298, 6:448}
```

### Total Attribute Power Map

*(0 → 120 mapped to 0 → 699)*

Used for final additive scoring.

## Stats & Levels

Each stat has a corresponding **icon** and is color-coded based on level:

| Level | Color       |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0     | Gray        |
| 1     | Light Red   |
| 2     | Orange      |
| 3     | Yellow      |
| 4     | Light Green |
| 5     | Light Blue  |
| 6     | Blue        |

Thresholds for levels are automatically calculated based on the sum of stat points.
